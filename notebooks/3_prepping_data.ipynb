He asked if I wanted to submit a loan application and I explicitly told him, \" No \\'\\'. I filed a complaint with Caliber Homes and no excuse or reason was provided for his unethical actions. Their response was, \" Since you decided not to move forward with the loan refinance process, the Loan Consultant was required to withdraw your application in our system. \" ( Direct quote ). As if this solves the problem. The issue is, I told him not to submit a loan application in the first place from the beginning. The call was recorded on their end. Caliber is saying that a loan number was required to be opened as part of their inquiry, so that the Loan Consultant could gather my information and be able to provide me the most accurate information available in regards to my refinance options. Even if this were the case, I should have been told that upfront and then why did he even ask if I wanted to move forward with submitting a loan application if this is normal/routine practice. I have spoken with plenty of other refinance companies and they were able to provide me with information that I requested without submitting an actual loan application. I believe that they are just trying to \" beef \\'\\' up their numbers.'"
